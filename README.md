# Task Manager Application 👨‍💼👨‍💻

*Task Manager app!* 👩‍💻 This project showcases my skills in building a robust task management application using cutting-edge technologies. The front end is developed with *Angular*, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface for a seamless task management experience. On the backend, *.NET* provides the backbone, ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure for efficient data handling. Task data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database, leveraging the power of *SQL* for data integrity and reliability.

The app features user authentication, allowing secure account creation for a personalized and private task management experience. With easy-to-use CRUD operations, users can add, edit, and delete tasks, marking them as complete or incomplete with just a click. Collaboration is a breeze, as the app allows users to share task lists and stay organized with seamless collaboration features. The app provides visual cues or reminders for tasks approaching their due date, keeping users on top of their schedules. 💻✨
